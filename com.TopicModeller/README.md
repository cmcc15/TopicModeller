## Appendix

List Of Classes:
-Control = This class is used to run the GUI
-GUI = This is the GUI for the user to use and will be a helpful interface for the user to use in order to access some of the features
-Topic modeller = This is a class that has all the main functionality of the assignment and will have any main analysis done upon the two documents

Description of Core Functionality:
The core functionality that I included was the ability for the user to find out if the two documents were about the same topic or not.
I also included the feature to see what the most common words with in the topics were and then I got them outputted back to the user
Another core functionality I used was the use of stop words and that if these stop words were in the text they would not be used. I gathered these stop words from an oniline source which was (https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords) 
I also included a basic overlap function that would look at the first 10 words and compare them and if it was something like 70% accurate it would state the documents are similar but if it was something like 40% it would state they are not similar.

Optional Functionality:
-I included a word count for the two documents
-I had the ability for all the uncommon words to be displayed
-Had the ability for new words to be added to the stop words list
-I had the ability for the list to be sorted in alphabetical order
-To get the most common word from both documents and see if they were similar
-Had the ability to read the two documents

More time:
If I had more time I would have definitely liked to have a file chooser where the user could simply pick which files they want to compare instead of having the files already manually in.
I would of also liked to have the feature where the output outputs to the GUI instead of just to the console itself.
